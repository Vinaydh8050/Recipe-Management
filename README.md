Recipe Management Application
A Recipe Management application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application allows users to manage recipes, including creating, reading, updating, deleting, and reordering them. Recipes are organized by categories, and users can also fetch a random recipe.

Features
Add, edit, and delete recipes.
Fetch all recipes or a recipe by ID.
Reorder recipes with drag-and-drop functionality.
Filter recipes by categories.
Fetch a random recipe.
Store recipes in MongoDB with Mongoose.
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing recipes.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
React: Frontend framework for the user interface (React components are implied in the app structure).
React Beautiful DnD: A library for drag-and-drop functionality on the frontend.
Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
MongoDB running locally or using a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-management-app.git
cd recipe-management-app
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Set up your MongoDB connection by creating a .env file in the root of the project with the following content:

bash
Copy
Edit
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
Replace your-mongodb-connection-string with the MongoDB connection string you want to use.

Start the application:

bash

Project Setup for Frontend (React)
This backend provides the API for handling recipes. The React frontend would interact with these APIs to display, add, update, and manage recipes.
The React app would typically make API calls to the backend (running on http://localhost:5000) using libraries like axios.
Example Frontend Endpoints for Interaction:
Fetching Recipes: GET /api/recipes
Fetching a Single Recipe: GET /api/recipes/:id
Adding a Recipe: POST /api/recipes
Updating Recipe Order: PUT /api/recipes/order
Deleting a Recipe: DELETE /api/recipes/:id
Error Handling
If an error occurs, the server responds with a 500 status code and a message explaining the error.
If a resource (e.g., a recipe) is not found, the server responds with a 404 status code and a message indicating the resource does not exist.
